4.Write a program to display “Hello” if a number entered by user is a multiple of five , otherwise print “Bye”.
5. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following **

** marks > 50: C grade**
else Failed.

6.Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s weight and height.
It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
• Under 18.5 they are underweight
• Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
• Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
• Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
• Above 35 they are clinically obese.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m) .
Take height and weight from the user.
